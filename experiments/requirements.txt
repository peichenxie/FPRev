# FPRev Experiment Dependencies
# 
# This file contains the Python package dependencies required to run the experimental
# evaluation of FPRev across different libraries and hardware platforms.
#
# Core Dependencies:
# -----------------
# numpy: Fundamental numerical computing library for CPU-based operations
#        - Provides sum(), dot(), matrix multiplication operations
#        - Uses optimized BLAS backends (Intel MKL, OpenBLAS)
#        - Version 1.26.* ensures compatibility with latest optimizations
#
# torch: PyTorch deep learning framework for GPU-accelerated operations  
#        - Provides CUDA-accelerated operations for GPU testing
#        - Includes Tensor Core support for specialized matrix operations
#        - Version 2.3.* includes recent performance improvements
#
# jax: Google's JAX library for high-performance numerical computing
#      - Provides JIT compilation through XLA backend
#      - Offers alternative computational paradigm for comparison
#      - Version 0.4.* includes latest XLA optimizations
#
# Utility Dependencies:
# --------------------
# pandas: Data analysis library for organizing and exporting experimental results
#         - Used for creating structured DataFrames from timing results
#         - Enables CSV export for further analysis and visualization
#
# graphviz: Graph visualization library for rendering summation trees
#           - Generates PDF visualizations of revealed accumulation orders
#           - Essential for case study outputs and qualitative analysis
#
# Installation Notes:
# ------------------
# - Install system-level graphviz first: sudo apt install graphviz
# - For GPU support, ensure CUDA toolkit and PyTorch GPU version are installed
# - NumPy performance depends on available BLAS implementation
# - JAX may require additional XLA dependencies for optimal performance
#
# Version Constraints:
# -------------------
# Specific version ranges ensure reproducibility and compatibility:
# - Patch versions allow bug fixes while maintaining API stability
# - Version ranges tested against the experimental configurations in the paper
